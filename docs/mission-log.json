    "body": "Client Log: I have transformed the AI Command Center into a high-fidelity **Conversational Operating System** based on the Nuxt Chat Template. This UI is designed for 100% full-screen immersion and pure performance. - **Immersion Overhaul**: We have completely eliminated card borders, margins, and external headers to reach 100% viewport occupancy. The interface is now a monolithic pure black (`#000000`) environment that provides maximum focus and a premium \"command center\" aesthetic. - **Architectural Branding**: Every instance of the generic chatbot logo has been purged and replaced with the official Auto-Notion SVG logo. This creates a unified institutional identity across the Architect node and the sidebar, ensuring the system feels proprietary and high-grade. - **Intelligent Input Node**: The input area is now a sophisticated mission-marshalling hub, featuring a model indicator for the \"AUTO-NOTION ARCHITECT\" and a high-contrast circular send button optimized for buttery smooth command execution. - **Snappy Orchestration**: Using `framer-motion`, the UI provides instant visual feedback and smooth transitions between the welcome screen and active chat streams, delivering a performance level that competes with world-class AI interfaces. - **Buttery Smooth Transitions**: Used `framer-motion` with optimized tap/hover states for that \"faster than ChatGPT\" feel. - **Conversational Logic**: The chat acts as the **CEO node**, sending commands to the AUTO-NOTION execution engine (n8n, Notion, Meta API). - **Sidebar History**: Redesigned sidebar with grouped history (Today) and system status (System Online/Local Node Active) in the footer. - **Production Ready**: `npm run build` completed successfully. - **Clean Code**: Resolved all TypeScript unused import/prop errors. - **Full-Screen Verified**: Confirmed `/agents` renders edge-to-edge without dashboard interference. The system is now a world-class, conversation-driven mission control center. One chat to rule the entire AUTO-NOTION ecosystem.\n\nMetadata: Pipeline Automated",
