    "title": "Upgraded Auto-Notion from a basic smart chat into a full AI Agency Control Plane with a clear Boss/Worker architecture, where Gemini acts as the strategic planner and delegates execution to Hugging Face workers. Introduced a strict, typed AgentAction schema to prevent hallucinations and enforce safe, predictable AI behavior. Enhanced the Mission Control UI with visible context chips (e.g., Instagram status and growth mode), a live system sidebar showing real-time states of Instagram, n8n, and Notion, and a transparent execution flow that separates Brain (Plan), Gear (Action), and Checkmark (Result) stages. Added verifiable workflows for planning, worker delegation, and system control, including structured status checks and JSON-based system responses. Implemented a safe HF fallback mode for environments without API keys and upgraded the super_deploy.sh script to support an agency-grade deployment lifecycle, synchronizing source, UI, and AI brain across GitHub, Firebase, and Hugging Face.",

This UI is designed for 100% full-screen immersion and pure performance. - **Immersion Overhaul**: We have completely eliminated card borders, margins, and external headers to reach 100% viewport occupancy. The interface is now a monolithic pure black (`#000000`) environment that provides maximum focus and a premium \"command center\" aesthetic. - **Architectural Branding**: Every instance of the generic chatbot logo has been purged and replaced with the official Auto-Notion SVG logo. This creates a unified institutional identity across the Architect node and the sidebar, ensuring the system feels proprietary and high-grade. - **Intelligent Input Node**: The input area is now a sophisticated mission-marshalling hub, featuring a model indicator for the \"AUTO-NOTION ARCHITECT\" and a high-contrast circular send button optimized for buttery smooth command execution. - **Snappy Orchestration**: Using `framer-motion`, the UI provides instant visual feedback and smooth transitions between the welcome screen and active chat streams, delivering a performance level that competes with world-class AI interfaces. - **Buttery Smooth Transitions**: Used `framer-motion` with optimized tap/hover states for that \"faster than ChatGPT\" feel. - **Conversational Logic**: The chat acts as the **CEO node**, sending commands to the AUTO-NOTION execution engine (n8n, Notion, Meta API). - **Sidebar History**: Redesigned sidebar with grouped history (Today) and system status (System Online/Local Node Active) in the footer. - **Production Ready**: `npm run build` completed successfully. - **Clean Code**: Resolved all TypeScript unused import/prop errors. - **Full-Screen Verified**: Confirmed `/agents` renders edge-to-edge without dashboard interference. The system is now a world-class, conversation-driven mission control center. One chat to rule the entire AUTO-NOTION ecosystem.\n\nMetadata: Pipeline Automated",
